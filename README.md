# Features

VERSION: 1.4.3

- See and filter both system and user units simultaneously.
- Supports all unit types.
- Units ordered by service, timer, socket, and the rest.
- Runs `sudo` automatically and only if necessary.
- Filter units by state using `ctrl-s` or the `--state` option.
- Run `daemon-reload` with `ctrl-r`.
- Has short versions of systemctl commands to reduce typing.
- Runs status after other commands (start, stop, restart, etc).
- Select multiple units, states, and commands using `TAB`.
- Only prompts commands based on current state
  (e.g. show "start" only if the unit is inactive).

# Usage

```text
A utility for using systemctl interactively via fzf.

Usage: sysz [OPTS...] [CMD] [-- ARGS...]

sudo is invoked automatically when controlling a system unit.
If sudo is not necessary to control systemd units on your machine, it can be omitted via the '--no-sudo' flag.

If only one unit is chosen, available commands will be presented
based on the state of the unit (e.g. "start" only shows if unit is "active").

OPTS:
  -u, --user               Only show --user units
  --sys, --system          Only show --system units
  -s STATE, --state STATE  Only show units in STATE (repeatable)
  --no-sudo                Do not invoke sudo
  -V, --verbose            Print the systemctl command
  -v, --version            Print the version
  -h, --help               Print this message

  If no options are given, both system and user units are shown.

CMD:
  start                  systemctl start <unit>
  stop                   systemctl stop <unit>
  r, restart             systemctl restart <unit>
  s, stat, status        systemctl status <unit>
  ed, edit               systemctl edit <unit>
  reload                 systemctl reload <unit>
  en, enable             systemctl enable <unit>
  d, dis, disable        systemctl disable <unit>
  c, cat                 systemctl cat <unit>

  If no command is given, one or more can be chosen interactively.

ARGS are passed to the systemctl command for each selected unit.

Keybindings:
  TAB           Toggle selection.
  ctrl-v        'cat' the unit in the preview window.
  ctrl-s        Select states to match. Selection is reset.
  ctrl-r        Run daemon-reload. Selection is reset.
  ctrl-p        History previous.
  ctrl-n        History next.
  ?             Show keybindings.

History:
  sysz is stored in $XDG_CACHE_HOME/sysz/history
  This can be changed with the environment variable: SYSZ_HISTORY

Some units are colored based on state:
  green       active
  red         failed
  yellow      not-found

Examples:
  sysz -u                      User units
  sysz --sys -s active          Active system units
  sysz --user --state failed   Failed user units

Examples with commands:
  sysz start                  Start a unit
  sysz --sys s                Get the status of system units
  sysz --user edit            Edit user units
  sysz s -- -n100             Show status with 100 log lines
  sysz --sys -s active stop    Stop an active system unit
  sysz -u --state failed r    Restart failed user units
```
